Hi, to use the base of this goadvent code login to your advent of code user and then copy the cookie session id to a file under the folder cookie named session-id.cookie!

The solver.go is a wraper so all of your solutions should be stored under the package solvers!

See the  example of day one and two solutions on how to add more solvers.

Merry Christmas!
